## Step x: Collision
Collision detection and handling is an incredibly important and often challenging subject in game design and development. Lucky for us, another benefit to snake being grid-based is that it makes collision checking and handling super easy!

We'll be able to handle all of it in a new method in our `Snake` class.
Edit `core/class/Snake.cs` and add the following method to `Snake`:
```csharp
private bool CheckCollision(Vector2 checkPos)
{
	return
		checkPos.X < 0 || checkPos.X > MainScene.GRID_SIZE - 1 || // check left/right walls
		checkPos.Y < 0 || checkPos.Y > MainScene.GRID_SIZE - 1 || // check top/bottom walls
		Positions.Contains(checkPos); // check self
}
```
If we call this method on the position our snake is trying to add to its position list and it returns `true`, we know our snake has hit a wall or itself.

Now that we have our `CheckCollision()` method, let's put it in `Move()`:
```csharp
private void Move()
{
	var newX = Head.X;
	var newY = Head.Y;

	switch (Direction)
	{
		case Direction.Up:
			newY = Head.Y - 1;
			break;
		case Direction.Down:
			newY = Head.Y + 1;
			break;
		case Direction.Left:
			newX = Head.X - 1;
			break;
		case Direction.Right:
			newX = Head.X + 1;
			break;
	}
	
	var newPos = new Vector2(newX, newY);

	// New section: collision check
	if (CheckCollision(newPos))
	{
		// We collided! ...but now what?
	}

	Positions.Insert(0, newPos);
	
	if (Positions.Count > Length)
	{
		Positions.Remove(Tail);
	}
}
```
Great, now our snake will check if the next position will cause a collision every time it moves, and we can respond when a collision does happen.

But how should we respond to a collision? We have many options, but one thing we know for sure is that it probably won't be the `Snake` class' job to ultimately respond to a collision. A collision will change the game's state in a way that should be the responsibility of `MainScene`.

So, how do we tell the `MainScene` that the `Snake` collided with something? There are two options that we may immediately choose from:

- Give `Snake` a reference to the MainScene and have the `Snake` instance invoke a method or change a property of `MainScene`
- Define an event in `Snake` that is invoked when a collision happens, and have `MainScene` subscribe to that event.

We're going to go with the second option.

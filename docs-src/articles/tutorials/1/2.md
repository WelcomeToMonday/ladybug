# Snake Tutorial Part 2: Sprites and Player Input
In this chapter, we'll go over creating a Sprite and polling player input to control its position.

In exploring sprites and input, we'll also be covering MonoGame's Content Pipeline and MGCB tool, and Ladybug's `KeyboardMonitor` and `ResourceCatalog` classes.

At the end of this chapter, your game application will produce a sprite that can be moved across the screen with either the keyboard's arrow keys or the WASD keys.

### Prerequisites
To complete the steps outlined in this chapter, you will need to have completed the steps in the [previous section](/articles/tutorials/1/1.html)

In addition, this chapter will be introducing the MonoGame Content Builder, which requires the MGCB Tool. For information on installing the MGCB tool, see the [Installation](/articles/getting-started/installation.html) article.

## Preface: What is Content?
Up until now, our `Game` instance has not had to render anything to the screen; all output so far has been to the console.

Now, as we start to work with graphical assets, we'll need to review Ladybug's concept of "Content".

In summary, Content is any external resource loaded into a game and used as an asset. These resources are usually image or audio resources, but can also involve data resources like JSON and XML.

### The MGCB Editor
MonoGame/XNA, which is the underlying framework for Ladybug, handles Content through a `ContentManager` class within the game code, and through the MGCB editor outside the code. If you don't have experience using the MGCB editor, it is recommended you [review this article](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/content/using_mgcb_editor.html) which details its basic usage.

Usage of the MGCB editor is essentially identical with Ladybug. The only addition to the process Ladybug adds is the `ResourceCatalog` class, which is a wrapper over a `ContentManager` that adds extra convenience.

## Step 1: Getting a Texture for our Sprite
To draw a Sprite to the screen, we'll need to have an image file to load its texture from.

We'll be needing a texture for the snake's body segments, ideally something symmetrical and uniform. A simple circle of solid color will be suitable, so that is what we will use.

You can download the sample assets for this tutorial [here](#).

### Adding the Texture to the Game
Once you have a texture created or downloaded, copy the file into `core/Content/image/snake.png`. Although the file is now in the Content folder within our game's structure, it is not quite yet accessible to our game code. To make `snake.png` available in our game, we'll need to add it using the MGCB Editor.

### Using the MGCB Tool

### Clarification: Textures vs. Sprites
In some contexts, textures and sprites can be thought of as similar, if not the same. However, in Ladybug, they are related, but are quite different:
* **Texture**: An image file that is loaded into a `Scene` as a resource.
* **Sprite**: An in-game visual representation of a texture, rendered at a particular location, size, scale, and rotation. Contains a reference to a texture, plus transform information about how/where/what portion that texture will be rendered.

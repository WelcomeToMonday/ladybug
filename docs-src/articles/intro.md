#### A MonoGame/XNA Extension Framework

Welcome to Ladybug -- an extension framework built on top of MonoGame/XNA. With Ladybug, building cross-platform games and applications with a lightweight, flexible engine is even easier. Use as many or as few Ladybug Modules as you need, and avoid having to bend your project so that it works the way the engine wants it to.

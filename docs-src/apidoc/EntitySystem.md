# Ladybug Entity Component System
The **Ladybug.ECS** namespace contains the components for Ladybug's Entity Component System.

## What is the Ladybug Entity Component System?
Ladybug's ECS makes it easy to create game entities by composing them from different components that each define a particular part of their behavior. In addition to making it easier to logically compose game entities, the ECS also organizes component logic in a way that makes it easy for a CPU to process large batches of components, improving performance.

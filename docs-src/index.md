#### A MonoGame/XNA Extension Framework

Welcome to Ladybug -- an extension framework built on top of MonoGame/XNA. With Ladybug, building cross-platform games and applications with a lightweight, flexible engine is even easier. Use as many or as few Ladybug Modules as you need, and avoid having to bend your project so that it works the way the engine wants it to.

If you haven't already, don't forget to check out our [Getting Started](/ladybug/articles/installation.html) guide, which will help you get set up with the prerequisites and get you started on an example project using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

This is the full Ladybug Framework, including all modules plus some enhanced capabilities built atop them.
See the API for details.

## Ladybug Modules
Ladybug is broken up into several Modules, allowing developers to pick and choose which parts they want to use. The goal of Ladybug is
to be able to use it as much or as little as you like!

### Scene Management

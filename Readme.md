# Ladybug Framework
###### A Welcome to Monday Project


Ladybug is an implementation of the MonoGame framework created to hasten development of games.

It is currently implemented as a series of wrapper classes around vital MonoGame functions, though it may be decoupled from MonoGame entirely in the distant future. We'll see!

The Ladybug Framework is currently in development, but a working proto-version of it is being used in a concurrent project. Once that project nears completion, its potentially portable components will be abstracted and moved to this project so that they can be reused in future projects.
